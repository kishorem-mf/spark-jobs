# Diagrams
These are diagrams for the engine. They are created using [plantuml](http://plantuml.com/). For Intellij and VSCode there are good plugins available for life previewing the result.

##
For rendering component diagrams [graphiz dot](https://www.graphviz.org/) is needed(you will get errors and instructions when it is nog available). The `GRAPHVIZ_DOT` env var should point to the dot executable present in the `bin`-directory of the graphviz installation.
